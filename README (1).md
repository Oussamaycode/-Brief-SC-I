1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuroi-hime/Virtual-Workspace.git

2. Switch to develop branch for development:
```bash
git switch -c develop
```
3. Commit and push changes to develop:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin develop
```
4. Once development is complete, merge into main:
```bash
git switch main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```
